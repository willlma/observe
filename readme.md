# Observe

This is a React Native project that aims to be a general event tracker for any type of event in your day-to-day life. Simply state what you did–e.g. _I walked 5 miles_–and it will calculate totals for how far you've walked, compare to previous walks, compare totals to other similar activities' totals, and chart those comparisons.

This is a personal project to learn React Native and charting with Formidable labs' [Victory charting library](http://formidable.com/open-source/victory/).

Look to [src/modules/core/](https://github.com/willlma/observe/tree/master/src/modules/core) for the source code.
